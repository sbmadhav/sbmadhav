# 👋 Hi, I'm **Madhav Srinivasan**
**Senior Director of Engineering | AI Systems Architect | Frontend Platform Leader | DevOps Transformation on GCP**

I build and scale high-performing engineering organizations that deliver modern frontend platforms, enterprise-grade AI systems, and mission-critical digital experiences. My work spans AI agents, voice systems, React/Next.js architectures, DevOps acceleration, and organizational design for engineering velocity.

I enjoy solving ambiguous, high-impact problems and driving zero-to-one initiatives from concept to production.
